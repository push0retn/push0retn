👋 Hi, I’m @push0retn!

💻 Interests:

💡 Digital circuitry

⌨️ Low-level programming using assembly language and C

⚙️ Intel processor architecture: real (16-bit), protected (x86), and long (x64) modes

🖥️ Operating system mechanisms, starting with MS-DOS and BIOS (internals)

🗂️ File systems: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, NTFS, etc.

🌱 About this repository:

📦 In this repository, I will be posting the source code of solved problems and lab work in assembly language covering various topics:

➕ Arithmetic operations

➡️ Branching instructions

🗄️ Stack operations

📁 File system interactions

👨‍💻 I hope that the works presented here will be useful for people interested in low-level programming and operating system internals.

📅 The repository will be updated regularly.

⚠️ Warning:

❗️ To compile the lab work source code, the MASM 6.11 package was used within the MS-DOS 6.22 operating system environment.
