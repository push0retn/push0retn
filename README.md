- 👋 Hi, I’m @push0retn 
- 👀 I am interested in digital circuitry, low-level programming using assembly language and C, Intel processor architecture and real (16), protected (x86) and long (x64) modes.
      I also study the mechanisms of operating systems starting with ms dos, bios (inside), file systems (fat12, fat16, fat32, ntfs...) etc.
- 🌱 In this repository, I will post the source codes of solved problems and laboratory work in Assembly language on various topics (arithmetic operations, branching instructions, stack operations, file systems, etc.).
      I hope that the presented works will be useful for people interested in low-level programming and operating system mechanisms.
      The repository will be updated regularly.
WARNING: To compile the source codes of laboratory work, the MASM 6.11 package was used in the context of the MS-DOS 6.22 operating system
